# s-n
Steps to modify:

1- Duplicate existing folder. Specifically, if the ad is horizontally oriented, select one that's already laid out that way.

2- Re-size the ad. Do this by changing the width/height of the .container_standard div. Also make sure to change the border and gradient accordingly.

3- If the text section of the ad isn't scrolling, check the z-index.

4- To adjust sprite images ( x and y axis up and down ex. background-position: -56 156; size. zoom: 110%; rotate. transform: 25%; )

5- If the scroll section of the banner is cutting off some of the text, adjust the height of #isi_standard #isi_scroll
